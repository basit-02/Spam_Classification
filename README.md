# Spam_Classification
<!-- Model Overview
The Email Spam Classification model was developed to automatically distinguish between legitimate (Ham) and unsolicited (Spam) emails. Given the structured nature of the dataset—which utilized a Bag-of-Words approach with 3,000 frequent word features—a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was implemented. This algorithm was selected for its proven efficiency in handling high-dimensional discrete data and its strength in text-based probability calculations.

Key Results
Accuracy: The model achieved an impressive accuracy of [Insert your accuracy, e.g., 97%], demonstrating high reliability in classification.

Precision & Recall: By analyzing the Confusion Matrix, the model showed a strong ability to minimize "False Positives" (preventing important emails from being marked as spam) while maintaining a high catch rate for actual spam.

Feature Insights: Visualizations through Word Clouds confirmed that terms such as "free," "click," and "money" were primary indicators of spam, validating the model’s focus on high-weight spam terminology.

Final Takeaway
This project successfully demonstrates the power of statistical machine learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The model provides a robust foundation for automated email filtering, ensuring a cleaner and more secure communication environment by accurately identifying malicious or promotional content based on word frequency patterns. -->
